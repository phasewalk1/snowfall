**_Snowfall_** is a novel anonymous polling protocol that leverages zk-SNARKs to provide private, verifiable voting. It's written in Rust, and makes extensive use of the [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) libraries. Many thanks to the amazing contributors who have built a delightful suite of crates for algebraic coding.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a student project. I'm trying to learn more about cryptography (and more specifically, ZK) engineering
> by working on real protocols. This is nowhere near usable yet, but any feedback about the protocol design and/or implementation is more than welcome!
